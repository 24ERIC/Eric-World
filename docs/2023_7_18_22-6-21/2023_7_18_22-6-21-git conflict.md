# git conflict
- how to deal with conflict 

    - Conflicting File Modifications:
        - Situation: Two or more contributors have made changes to the same section of a file.
        - Solution: Manually resolve the conflict by reviewing the conflicting sections, choosing the desired changes, and removing the conflict markers (e.g., "<<<<<<<", "=======", ">>>>>>>").

    - Conflicting Branch Merges:
        - Situation: When merging branches, Git detects conflicting changes in the files being merged.
        - Solution: Use Git's automatic merge capabilities: Git attempts to merge the changes automatically. You can review and resolve conflicts by following the same manual resolution process mentioned above.Use Git's interactive rebase: Perform an interactive rebase to modify the order of commits and resolve conflicts as they arise during the rebase process.

    - Deleted File Conflict:
        - Situation: One contributor deletes a file while another contributor makes modifications to the same file.
        - Solution: Manually resolve the conflict by deciding whether to keep the file deleted or to restore it with the modifications. Remove the conflict markers accordingly.

    - Renamed File Conflict:
        - Situation: One contributor renames a file, and another contributor modifies the same file with its original name.
        - Solution: Manually resolve the conflict by determining the desired file name and applying the changes accordingly. Update the file name in Git and remove the conflict markers.

    - Conflict during Pull:
        - Situation: When pulling changes from a remote repository, conflicts occur due to changes made both locally and remotely.
        - Solution:Stash your changes: Save your local changes using Git stash, pull the remote changes, and then apply your stashed changes on top. Resolve conflicts during the pull: Git will prompt you to resolve conflicts during the pull operation. Use the manual resolution process to address them.

    - Conflict during Rebase:
        - Situation: During a Git rebase operation, conflicts arise when applying commits on top of a new base.
        - Solution: Git will pause the rebase process and prompt you to resolve conflicts. Follow the manual resolution process, stage the resolved changes, and continue the rebase process using "git rebase --continue".
