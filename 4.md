# CSC263 Data Structures and Analysis - Graph

- G=(V,E)
    - V -> Set of vertices -> node
    - E -> Set of edges -> line
- Directed / undirected graph -> has arrow
- Unweighted / Weighted -> have number on edge
- Simple / Non-simple -> multi edge + self-edge
- Acyclic / Cyclic -> exist a cycle
- Connected / Disconnected -> 
- Path -> a sequence of edges
- length of path -> number of edges / sum of weights
- operations on graph
    - add / remove vertex
    - add / remove edge
    - determine weather (i,j) is an edge
    - get neightbours (undirected graph)
        - neighbourhood(u)
    - get in-neighbours / out-neightbours (directed graoh)
    - traversal: visit every vertex in graph
